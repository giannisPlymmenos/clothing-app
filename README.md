# Clothing Store Application ðŸ‘•

This is an application built with Angular and Node.js. Designed as a learning project, it demonstrates how to implement core CRUD operations with a clean, user-friendly UI. The app allows users to view a list of products, edit product details, and delete products with a confirmation step.

## Features

- **Add Products**: Add new products to the catalog, specifying details like name, price, image, and rating.
- **Display Products**: Display a list of products with details and ratings in a structured, responsive format.
- **Update Products**: Edit existing product information directly within the catalog view.
- **Delete Products**: Remove products with a confirmation popup to prevent accidental deletions.

## Tech Stack

- **Angular**: Frontend framework for building the component-based architecture and managing data binding.
- **Node.js**: Backend server for handling API requests and managing data.
- **Express**: Framework for building the API endpoints and serving the backend.
- **PrimeNG**: UI library for pre-built, responsive components like buttons, modals, and rating widgets.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and robust development for both Angular and Node.js.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for additional design tweaks and layout management.
- **HTML**: Provides structured component templates.

## Learning Objectives

This project serves as a hands-on exploration of CRUD operations, component communication, and responsive design in a full-stack environment. Key learning points include:
- Creating standalone Angular components with reusable UI features.
- Using Angular services and Node.js API routes to manage and interact with data.
- Integrating PrimeNG for an enhanced user experience.
